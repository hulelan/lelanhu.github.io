Over the years, I've experimented with various productivity systems. From GTD to Bullet Journaling, from complex app setups to simple pen and paper. Here's what actually works for me.

## The Core Principles

My system is built on three principles:

1. **Capture everything**: If it's in your head, it's taking up mental space
2. **Review regularly**: Systems fail without consistent review
3. **Keep it simple**: Complexity is the enemy of execution

## The Tools

I keep my toolkit minimal:

- **Notes app**: For quick capture and reference
- **Calendar**: Time-blocked for deep work
- **Task manager**: Simple lists, nothing fancy
- **Journal**: For reflection and planning

## The Daily Routine

My day follows a simple pattern:

1. **Morning planning** (10 min): Review calendar, set three priorities
2. **Deep work blocks**: 90-minute focused sessions
3. **Afternoon review** (5 min): Quick progress check
4. **Evening reflection** (10 min): What went well, what didn't

## The Weekly Review

Every Sunday, I spend 30 minutes:

- Reviewing the past week
- Planning the upcoming week
- Clearing my inbox
- Updating my project list

## What Doesn't Work

I've learned that these don't work for me:

- Over-complicated systems
- Too many tools
- Rigid time-boxing
- Perfectionism

## The Key Insight

The best productivity system is the one you actually use. Start simple, iterate based on what works, and don't be afraid to abandon what doesn't serve you.

Remember: productivity is not about doing more things, it's about doing the right things well.
