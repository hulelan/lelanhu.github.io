After much deliberation, I've finally launched my personal website. This has been something I've wanted to do for a while, and I'm excited to have a space to share my thoughts and ideas.

## Why Now?

The timing felt right for several reasons:

1. **A place to write**: I've been writing more lately and wanted a permanent home for my thoughts
2. **Learning in public**: Sharing what I learn helps me understand it better
3. **Connection**: A way to connect with others who share similar interests

## What to Expect

This site will be a mix of:

- **Technical posts**: Sharing what I learn about programming and technology
- **Productivity insights**: Systems and tools that help me work better
- **Personal reflections**: Thoughts on life, learning, and growth
- **Annual reviews**: Yearly letters and "State of the Apps" posts

## The Technical Details

For those interested, this site is built with:
- Jekyll for static site generation
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Minimal custom CSS for styling
- No JavaScript (unless absolutely necessary)

The goal is to keep things simple, fast, and focused on the content.
