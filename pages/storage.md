- Visakan Veerasamy exists on [Twitter](https://x.com/visakanv), [two](https://visakanv.gumroad.com/l/FANbook) [books](https://visakanv.gumroad.com/l/introspect), [Substack](https://visakanv.substack.com/), and [some amalgamation of websites](https://www.visakanv.com/blog/talking-points/). His "elaborate, interwoven [twitter] threads" led me into Internet spaces and hence subcultures that I remain a lurker in, even today.
- [bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/) is perhaps the only blog for which I've read every single post since I came across it. I do think it's the same topic over and over again, but (1) it's a nice thing to read about over and over again (2) each post is slightly different (3) she cites other works often, and in-context recommendations are always superior to general recommendations. There's an array of other blogs I've enjoyed reading, like [Escaping Flatland](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/), [first draft repo](https://genasoh.substack.com/)
- [let's get enlightened, from aella](https://aella.substack.com/p/lets-get-enlightened). It seems like Aella's life was better before she reached "social media escape velocity," where she became known for just One Particular Thing, but this was a great piece from her breadth of coverage.
