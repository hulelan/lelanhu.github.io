The form of this README is shamelessly poached from Zhengdong Wang. He starts his README with the following:
    Instead of attempting the daunting task of writing about myself (I am perennially unhappy with the results), here is a collection of things I want to associate myself with. They are things I like, things I think about, things that have influenced me. You can interpolate the rest.

I'll add that writing about yourself also fossilizes one possible story. While it's true that you ought to make yourself knowable to others to live effectively in the world, narrative dynamism is important to an expansive life. 

A totalizing meme. It is true, it is false, and it is somewhere in between.

    <details> 
    Before them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids. The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface of stones. The whole structure seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of the birds. Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers.
