The form of this README is shamelessly poached from Zhengdong Wang. He starts his README with the following:
    Instead of attempting the daunting task of writing about myself (I am perennially unhappy with the results), here is a collection of things I want to associate myself with. They are things I like, things I think about, things that have influenced me. You can interpolate the rest.

I'll add that writing about yourself also fossilizes one possible story. While it's true that you ought to make yourself knowable to others to live effectively in the world, narrative dynamism is important to an expansive life. 

I begin with this meme, the modern version of yin-yang. I believe in it sometimes.
