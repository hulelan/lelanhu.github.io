The form of this README is shamelessly poached from Zhengdong Wang. He starts his README with the following:
    *<i>Instead of attempting the daunting task of writing about myself (I am perennially unhappy with the results), here is a collection of things I want to associate myself with. They are things I like, things I think about, things that have influenced me. You can interpolate the rest.</i>*

I'll add that writing about yourself also fossilizes one possible story. A person is too complex to fit in even their own mind, so while you must distill that into a story to make yourself legible to others, an expansive life requires that you retain internal narrative dynamism. There are many stories implicit in this, but let us live out a different one. 

A totalizing meme. It is true, it is false, and it is somewhere in between. 
![Ayy lmao meme](/assets/images/ayy-lmao.png)

I was born shortly after China formally allowed private enterprises and joined the WTO. I was also raised on science fiction, courtesy of my father. Both gave me a taste of and for infinite "progress." Technology makes life better for everyone, but humanity's self-destructive tendencies will persist.

Some titles on humanity as we exist in collectives. 
- *More Money Than God* is awesome and fun. The swashbucklers who were right.  
- *The Prize* is technically a history of oil, but it's really a wonderful depiction of "economics" and "politics" as they exist at the more granular level of individual interactions and choices. 
- *Varieties of Capitalism* is a pretty classic political science text. In the "ayy lmao" between grand theories and small experiments, it's a "new theorization of the grand theory of institutions." I liked its relatively expansive reach and tolerance of gray areas between its categories. 
- *Poor Economics* is a "small experiments" volume. I ended up going through their development economics certification too, and there's something wonderful about the thought that you can make incremental progress towards solving the big problems of hunger and disease. 
- *Faith in Moderation* from Jillian Schwedler was somewhere in between. I don't remember most of the claims, but I remember it as the first book that connected it theorization to the specificity of the real world, moved between layers of abstractions, and was incredibly granular and precise in its analysis and claims. 

Some titles on progress (or the difficulty of progress).
- *Chasing the Flame* 
- *Pieces of the Action* 
- Jobs
- Michael Nielsen's [Augmenting Long-term Memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html). Spaced repetition flash cards might not seem so related to "progress," but as [gwern](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition#where-was-i-going-with-this) says, "It’s a testament to the Enlightenment ideal of improving humanity through reason and overcoming our human flaws...it’s really nice to just have a small example like this in one’s daily life, an example not yet so prosaic and boring as the lightbulb." 

Some titles on humanity as we exist as individuals. Is this philosophy? Is this religion? Is this Twitter discourse? Is this about experience or about reality? I probably signal ignorance by mixing everything together, but I am ignorant and hence cannot help it.

  <summary>There is no such thing as excerpting propositions, but here are some: </summary>
  
  *5.6 <i>The limits of my language</i> mean the limits of my world.*
  *6.5 <b> When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be stated.*
    *There is no such thing as <i>the riddle</i>.*
    
    *If a question can be posed at all, then it <i>can</i> also be answered. </b>**

  *6.521 The solution to the problem of life is found in the vanishing of the problem.*

    *(Is this not the reason why those to whom the meaning of life became clear after prolonged doubt, could not then say in what this meaning consisted?)*

  *6.522 There is, though, the ineffable.*
    *This <i>shows</i> itself, it is the mystical.*

Some titles on beauty. 
**Math** 
One of the best things to happen to me (and worst things for my GPA) was studying math in college. I had done barely any STEM in high school. I didn’t think I could do it. I didn’t think I wanted to do it. Turns out I just needed a proofs class to transform me with the really unmatchable sensation of "understanding truth" and seeing the world in a new way. 
- *A Mathematician's Lament* from Paul Lockhart on the terrible way math is usually taught. It's a book about mathematics as art and play and the what it might mean to actually understand something. 
- Andrew Neitzke's class notes for Real Analysis. 

**To Be Read**
- Gabriel García Márquez' *A Hundred Years of Solitude*.

  <summary>An excerpt</summary>
  
  Before them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids. The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface of stones. The whole structure seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of the birds. Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers.
