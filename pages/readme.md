The form of this README is shamelessly poached from Zhengdong Wang. He starts [his README](https://zhengdongwang.com/readme) with the following:

> *Instead of attempting the daunting task of writing about myself (I am perennially unhappy with the results), here is a collection of things I want to associate myself with. They are things I like, things I think about, things that have influenced me. You can interpolate the rest.*

I'll add that writing about yourself also fossilizes one possible story. A person is too complex to fit in even their own mind, so while you must distill that into a story to make yourself legible to others, an expansive life requires that you retain internal narrative dynamism. There are many stories implicit in this list, but let us live out a better one.

**The Collective**
- *Varieties of Capitalism* is a "classic political science text." In the "ayy lmao" between grand theories and small experiments, it's a "new theorization of the grand theory of institutions." I liked its relatively expansive reach and tolerance of gray areas between its categories. 
- *Poor Economics* is a "small experiments" volume. I ended up going through their development economics certification too, and there's something wonderful about the thought that you can make incremental progress towards solving the big problems of hunger and disease. 
- *Faith in Moderation* from Jillian Schwedler is somewhere in between. I don't remember most of the claims, but I remember it as the first book that connected it theorization to the specificity of the real world, moved between layers of abstractions, and was incredibly granular and precise in its analysis and claims. 
- *Breakneck* from Dan Wang. Complicated things require thinking that allows multitudes and apparent contradictions. This is one such book.  
- I do really enjoy [Citrini](https://www.citriniresearch.com/). 
- *More Money Than God* is very fun and a great way to "live" markets.
- *The Prize* is technically a history of oil, but it's really a wonderful depiction of "economics" and "politics" as they exist at the more granular level of individual interactions and choices. 

**Progress**
- Samantha Power's *Chasing the Flame*. Sérgio Vieira de Mello was a Brazilian/UN diplomat with a long (but not long enough) career contending with evil and suffering in basically every failed state and warzone in the late 20th century. He was the first official to speak to Khmer Rouge; in the Balkans talking to the Serbs, the Albanians, and the Americans; he was in Sergio post-genocide figuring out how to be humanitarian without fueling war; he was in East Timor setting up the pseudo-interim-government...(Apparently someone joked that his autobiography ought to be titled “My Friends, the War Criminals.”) Despite the standard impossibilities of international politics and violent local grievances, it has filled me with hope that a single competent person can do so much, and that there are people who found a way to hold both idealism and pragmatism in one life. He died in the suicide bombing of Canal Hotel in Baghdad, on August 19, 2003. 
- Vannevar Bush's *Pieces of the Action* 
- Jobs
- Michael Nielsen's [Augmenting Long-term Memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html). Spaced repetition flash cards might not seem so related to "progress," but as [gwern](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition#where-was-i-going-with-this) says, "It’s a testament to the Enlightenment ideal of improving humanity through reason and overcoming our human flaws...it’s really nice to just have a small example like this in one’s daily life, an example not yet so prosaic and boring as the lightbulb." 

**Technology** 

Really this should be bundled in "progress," since progress is the result of a supportive context (hence politics, economics) for great science and its applications, but we'll leave it separated. Despite America's loss of manufacturing communities and the resulting "process knowledge," the online community for non-physical technology is really great. I have really enjoyed reading from [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/), and [Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/).

**Beingness**

- Bhagavad Gita. Easwaran's introduction is quite clear as well. I also found the Dhammapada (also Easwaran) and Siddhartha (from Herman Hesse) educational in complementary ways. 
- Marilynne Robinson's *Gilead*
- Wittgenstein's *Tractatus*

  <summary>There is no such thing as excerpting propositions, but here are some: </summary>
  
  > *5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.*
  

  > *6.5 When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be stated.*
  >> *There is no such thing as the riddle.*
  >> *If a question can be posed at all, then it can also be answered.*

  > *6.521 The solution to the problem of life is found in the vanishing of the problem.*
  >> *(Is this not the reason why those to whom the meaning of life became clear after prolonged doubt, could not then say in what this meaning consisted?)*

  > *6.522 There is, though, the ineffable.*
  >> *This shows itself, it is the mystical.*

**Math** 

We can all be transformed with the really unmatchable sensation of "understanding truth" and seeing the world in a new way. 
- *A Mathematician's Lament* from Paul Lockhart on the terrible way math is usually taught. What might it mean to actually understand something? 
- Andrew Neitzke's class notes for Real Analysis. 
- [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), how can it be otherwise. 
- There are various Quanta Magazine pieces that illustrate what math can be. [insert some favorites]

**Literature**
- Gabriel García Márquez' *A Hundred Years of Solitude*.

  <summary>An excerpt</summary>
  
  Before them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids. The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface of stones. The whole structure seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of the birds. Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers.
